# Marketing for December Consideration

I'm seeking feedback on marketing activities to focus on in December.

## Financial Position
* Projected cash by end of this month (December 2024): $40k
* Monthly burn rate: $10k
* Monthly revenue from traditional business unit: $1k
* Potential runway: 6 months

## Business Status
* The previous product is defined to be AI-assisted Photo Book Designer tool.
  Proven unit economy. For around 50 recruits, 28 made an order. 
* The new vision is to be a daily ritual to pause and reflect on the photos
  taken on a day. Where the order bt the end of a month is a natural outcome.
* Current focus is on product iteration and retention optimization.
* KPI is D1 and D7 retention.
* Biggest challenge is lack of a constant stream of users. 

## Target Audience
* The audience are parents in third trimester and new parents.
* Paid Google AdWords CAC is too high to be affordable.
* Paid Reddit ads gives no installs despite it claims 70+ clicks.
* Paid in-app ads through established pregnancy apps are too unaffordable.

## Marketing Options
1. Organically recruit from subreddits
2. Podcasts appearances targeting pregancy.
3. Tech media with the "new" angle.
4. Reach out to micro-influencers
5. Partnership with other brands (We are a week into December now. end of the year, not sure this is viable.)

Would appreciate your thoughts on this.
