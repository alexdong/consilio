# Personal Brand vs. Business Brand Consideration

I'm seeking feedback on whether I should invest in personal brand or business brand.

## Business Context
* The business develops family photo curation app using AI. We make money when people prints 
  the curated memories as photo books.
* Target audiences are parents in third trimester and new parents. Mainly female between 25-35.
* Most photos taken during the first 18 months of a child's life.
* The business has tight budget. We can't really afford spending loads of money on ads. It'll 
  remain a solo endeavour until we have proven unambiguosly the product-market-fit.

## Personal Context
* I value family memories and I firmly believe the nostalgie helps children to
  develop a sense of self, which will be critical in a world where everything
  is accelerating.
* I built the business because I experienced the photo overwhelm pains my target market feel.
* I'm Asian tech father in mid-forties. 
* I find it awkward to participate in most female pregnancy channels.
* I am a good communicator. I love talking to people and I have interesting stories to share.
* "Spill over" effect: I have had female customers who heard of us from their husbands.
* I am a simple, authentic person. I hate pretentious acts. I thrive when I can be myself.
* I might be the perfect person at the current stage of the business where
  product/design/engineering is the most important thing. But someone else
  might be a better fit when the business' need changes. 

I'm wondering instead of building a business brand in a community I'm not part
of, maybe I should spend time building a personal brand. Something like "tech dad with a mission"
and let the "spill over" effect to help my messages reach my target audience.

Concretely, this means that instead of publishing on the business's blog, I
should publish on my personal blog. Instead of participating under a business
handle on reddit, I should use my personal one.
