# Business Loan Consideration

I'm seeking feedback on taking out a $25k small business loan to extend our runway. Here's our current situation:

## Financial Position
* Projected cash by end of this month (December 2024): $40k
* Monthly burn rate: $10k
* Monthly revenue from traditional business unit: $1k

## Business Status
* We've validated our unit economics in Q3.
* Current focus is on product iteration and retention optimization
* Customer acquisition is primarily organic, intentionally not scaling paid acquisition yet
* Our existing convertible note investors will not invest until we prove an outstanding metrics.

## Additional Context
* We're planning to sell the traditional business unit through an asset sales.
* Expected sale price. 3 valuation from brokers are: 80k, 160k and 170k.
* Typical sale process: 3-6 months (possibly longer)
* We have a positive credit history with the bank, having successfully repaid a previous loan

## Proposed Loan Terms (3-year)
* Monthly payment: $794.99
* Total interest: $3,619.76
* Total repayment: $28,619.76
* Loan would be secured against the traditional business unit

## Rationale
My rationale for pursuing the loan is to provide additional runway while we:
1. Complete the sale of the traditional business
2. Continue working toward product-market fit

Would appreciate your thoughts on this.
