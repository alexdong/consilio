# Development Workflow

This document outlines the standard development workflow for contributing to the project.

## Prerequisites

- Git installed on your local machine
- Access to the project repository
- Proper development environment setup

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Create a New Branch

Always start your work by creating a new feature branch from the main branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature-name
```

### 2. Make Changes

Make your necessary code changes in your local development environment. Follow these best practices:

- Adhere to the project's coding standards
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Include comments where necessary
- Update documentation as needed

### 3. Test Your Changes

Before committing, ensure all tests pass with 100% coverage:

```bash
make test-coverage
```

Review the coverage report and add tests if necessary to maintain full coverage.

### 4. Commit Changes

Commit your changes using conventional commit messages:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: Add new feature"
```

Common commit types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `style`: Formatting changes
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### 5. Push Changes

Push your changes to your fork:

```bash
git push origin feature-name
```

### 6. Create Pull Request

1. Go to the project repository on GitHub
2. Click "New Pull Request"
3. Select your feature branch
4. Fill in the PR template with:
   - Description of changes
   - Related issue numbers
   - Testing steps
   - Screenshots (if applicable)
5. Request reviews from team members

### 7. Review Process

- Address any feedback from reviewers
- Make requested changes
- Push additional commits as needed
- Ensure CI/CD pipeline passes

## Best Practices

- Keep branches focused on single features or fixes
- Regularly sync your branch with the main branch
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Break large changes into smaller, reviewable chunks
- Test thoroughly before requesting review

## Need Help?

If you need assistance at any point:
- Check the project documentation
- Ask in the team chat channel
- Reach out to project maintainers

Remember to keep your branch up to date with the main branch while working on your features to minimize merge conflicts.
