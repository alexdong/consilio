The detailed situation, including goals, context, options, and considerations have been provided.

<decision>
{{DECISION}}
</decision>

Your task is to analyze this information thoroughly and formulate insightful
questions. Please follow these steps:

1. Carefully read and understand the situation, paying close attention to all
   provided details.

2. Note down the information you have received:
   - Break down the key elements of the situation
   - Identify potential risks, opportunities, and assumptions in the plan
   - Evaluate short-term and long-term implications of the decision
   - Wrap your analysis process inside <observations></observations> tags.  

    <observations>
        <observation>[summary of the observation]</observation>
        [More observations]
    </observations>

3. Brainstorm 7-10 questions that explores and clarify information that is
critical to the decision but is absent in the <situation></situation>.
Prioritize areas where your questions could have the most significant impact
that accomplish one or more of the following:

   - Point out potential oversights or gaps in the current plan or proposal
   - Suggest alternative approaches or solutions
   - Stress test the thoroughness of the preparation and planning
   - Open up discussion on specific aspects you find particularly important

For each question, provide a clear and concise explanation, including the
context and rationale behind asking it.

    <questions>
        <question>[Describe what information you are seeking. Detail description on how the response could impact the decision?]</question>
        [More questions]
    </questions>

Remember, your goal at this step is not to provide answers, but to gain a
comprehensive understanding of the context.

Provide deep, insightful clarification questions that challenge assumptions and
explore potential issues the founder may not have considered. Prioritize depth
and potential impact over surface-level inquiries.

Please produce your response to the following structure:

```md
<observe>
    <observations>
        <observation>Test observation 1</observation>
        <observation>Test observation 2</observation>
    </observations>
    <questions>
        <question>Test question 1?</question>
        <question>Test question 2?</question>
    </questions>
</observe>
```

Please proceed with your observations.
