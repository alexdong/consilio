Here is the founder's situation:

<founder_situation>
{{FOUNDER_SITUATION}}
</founder_situation>


The founder has presented a detailed business situation, including goals, context, options, and considerations. Your task is to analyze this information thoroughly and formulate three insightful questions that will help guide the founder's decision-making process.

When analyzing the situation and formulating your questions, please follow these steps:

1. Carefully read and understand the founder's situation, paying close attention to all provided details.

Wrap your analysis process inside <analysis> tags.  Within these tags:

1. Note down the information you have received:
   - Break down the key elements of the situation (financial, strategic, market-related, etc.)
   - Identify potential risks, opportunities, and assumptions in the founder's plan
   - Consider alternative approaches or solutions that may not have been mentioned
   - List key stakeholders and their potential concerns
   - Evaluate short-term and long-term implications of the decision
   - Prioritize areas where your questions could have the most significant impact on the decision
   - Brainstorm at least 5-7 potential questions based on your analysis, sort by impact on business.

2. Prioritize the questions with a score that is according to their impact that accomplish one or more of the following:
   - Point out potential oversights or gaps in the current plan or proposal
   - Suggest alternative approaches or solutions
   - Stress test the thoroughness of the preparation and planning
   - Open up discussion on specific aspects you find particularly important

3. For each question, provide a clear and concise explanation, including the context and rationale behind asking it.

After the <analysis> tag, provide a list of no more than three other relevant perspectives you want to consult to get a more comprehensive view of the situation.  Wrap this section in the following structure:

<consult>
  <perspective>
    <title>[A brief, description for the extra perspective you'd like to consult]</title>
    <question>[What information you are seeking. Detail description on how the response could impact the decision]</question>
  </perspective>
</consult>

Remember, your goal is to provide deep, insightful questions that challenge assumptions and explore potential issues the founder may not have considered. Prioritize depth and potential impact over surface-level inquiries.

Please proceed with your analysis.
