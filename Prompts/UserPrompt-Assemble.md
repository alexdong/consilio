Here is the decision that needs to be examined:

<decision>
{{DECISION}}
</decision>

Your task is to recommend 3-5 different perspectives from which to examine this decision. This is crucial for exploring alternatives and gathering necessary information to weigh options effectively.

Before providing your final recommendations, please conduct a thorough analysis of the situation. Wrap your analysis inside <analysis> tags:

<analysis>
1. List the key decision points identified in the situation.
2. Identify all relevant stakeholders who might be affected by or have input on the decision.
3. Outline potential impacts of the decision on various aspects of the business (e.g., product development, market positioning, financial implications, customer acquisition).
4. Brainstorm at least 7 initial ideas for perspectives that could provide valuable insights:
   a. For each idea, write a brief description and note its unique angle.
   b. Consider perspectives from different departments, industries, or stakeholder groups.
   c. Think about both internal and external perspectives.
5. Evaluate the diversity of your initial ideas:
   a. Are there any major gaps or overlooked areas?
   b. Do the perspectives cover a range of short-term and long-term considerations?
6. Consider potential biases or blind spots in your initial list of perspectives.
7. From these initial ideas, select the 3-5 most relevant and diverse perspectives that will provide a comprehensive view of the situation.
8. For each selected perspective, draft:
   - A clear title describing the perspective
   - An explanation of its relevance to the decision
   - Three specific questions you would ask an expert from this perspective
   - For each question, explain how the answer would impact the decision-making process
9. Double-check that each perspective has exactly 3 questions and that the impact of each answer is clearly explained.
</analysis>

Based on your analysis, present your final recommendations using the following structure:

<perspectives>
  <perspective>
    <title>[A brief, clear description of the perspective, including the domain of expertise or stakeholder group it represents]</title>
    <relevance>[A concise explanation of why this perspective is important for the decision at hand]</relevance>
    <questions>
      <question>
        [A specific question you would ask an expert from this perspective]
        [Explanation of how the answer to this question could impact the decision]
      </question>
      <question>
        [Second question for this perspective]
        [Explanation of how the answer to this question could impact the decision]
      </question>
      <question>
        [Third question for this perspective]
        [Explanation of how the answer to this question could impact the decision]
      </question>
    </questions>
  </perspective>
  [Repeat the <perspective> structure for each of the 3-5 perspectives you've identified]
</perspectives>

Remember:
- Ensure that each perspective is clearly defined and distinct from the others.
- Provide exactly 3 questions for each perspective.
- For every question, include a clear explanation of how the answer will impact the decision-making process.
- The goal is to identify perspectives that will provide a comprehensive understanding of the situation, potential consequences, and alternative approaches that may not have been initially considered.

DO NOT output the analysis. 
DO respond with the <perspectives></perspectives>.

Please proceed with your analysis and recommendations.
